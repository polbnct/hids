# hids
Host-Based Intrusion Detection System

This is a Simple Project to better understand the world of detection system


Hmm.. How to do this??

Idea:
- HIDS that will use SHA256 to check if a file have been changed or not
- Scan through a folder? / Testing ofc
- Detect new SHA256 or deleted / New file that have been added or Removed
- Trigger 1 or 0
- If try -> Notify who?

Things to Create:
- Scanner that will scan the whole folder
- Test Folder (maybe add in the project)
- Automation that will hash the values in the folder
- Automation that will scan the second value of the folder
- Automation that will compare the value
- Notification that will be sent to the creator
- What notification?
- Maybe expand in more folders? / Consider in future
